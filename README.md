- [Graphical criteria for identification in continuous-time marginal structural survival models](https://github.com/palryalen/paper-code/tree/master/Graphical%20criteria%20for%20identification%20in%20continuous-time%20marginal%20structural%20survival%20models) (2020) 
> Code for the HPV example in the paper, applied to a simulated data set with similar features. Uses the [ahw](https://github.com/palryalen/ahw) package

- [Prognosis of cancer survivors, estimation based on differential equations](https://github.com/palryalen/paper-code/tree/master/Prognosis%20of%20cancer%20survivors,%20estimation%20based%20on%20differential%20equations) (2020) 
> Code for estimating the parameters displayed in the application section, applied to simulated data sets. Uses the [transform.hazards](https://github.com/palryalen/transform.hazards) package
